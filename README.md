# visual-sorting-algorithms

Visualizing five different sorting algorithms in Python using the graphics.py library,
with bars in a window representing integers.

Colors were added to support understanding of how some of the algorithms work. The goal of using colors
was not to precisely describe the way the algorithm works (specifically regarding swapping/checking in insertion sort),
but rather to aid a very basic understanding of the algorithm.
